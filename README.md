## Hi I'm Jasmyn!

### I'm excited about efficiency, growth and connection.

When I code, I focus on:
- Developer empathy 
- User experience
- Beautiful design

Things I love
- 🍪 Cookies (specifically any peanut butter cookie from Crumbl )
- 🚵🏽‍♀️ ⛷ 🧗🏽‍♀️ Movement in the outdoors 
- 🤪 Laughing at myself (opportunities abound)
- 🏐 Spikeball
- 📚 Learning
